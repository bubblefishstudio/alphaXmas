# alphaXmas

> This project, AlphaXmas, is a multimedia installation aimed to bring the audience into an experience of watching a computer generated tree growing, with a computer generated music melody in the background. The growing plant is generated using a 3D model built from an L-system and the music melody is generated using a LSTM neural networks. The generated music melodies are short monophonic Christmas carol compositions obtained from a LSTM-RNN Model. We train the model using the Hymns and Carols of Christmas dataset with around 1k historical compositions.

This is a Hackathon project for a.y. 2020-2021 Creative Programming and Computing Course of MSc. in Music and Acoustic Engineering @ Politecnico di Milano.
The hackathon date is on Dec. 18th 2020, while the final presentation is on Sep. 8th 2021.
